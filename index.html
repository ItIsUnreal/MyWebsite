              <p>
                Here I had the most interesting years of my life and I met a lot of people. Because I was mature at that age, I understood that from now on the studies will be for me and not for the appreciation of my parents. So even if I was not that dedicated person who got all the projects on time I learned how to became it. Because at that age, you have to stop taking everything for granted and do something for it!  Sounds sad, but in reality it was much easier than I expected. In the first year I found every subject so complicated, but after I started putting in the work, it was so easy and really fun to understand a lot of useful things. Most of the programming languages from this <b>portfolio</b> were learned in faculty, plus I learned from the best teachers in the country. No wonder my faculty was the most wanted by all high school graduates. Also, all the fun activities that my faculty had to offer really convinced me that I made the right choice when I said "Mom, I want to be an <b>engineer</b>!".

              <p>
                I could write about the funny experiences that happened in my highschool all day long, but you don't have time to read all that, so I'm going to keep it short for you! In highschool I had my first encounter with programming since then I was like "Yeah, programming, sounds good, but what is it?", there I had my first touch with it, with my first programming language <b>C++</b> and I loved it! The first time our teacher showed us the most basic program in the world, the "Hello World!" program, I was so shocked. The nostalgia got me. I was already thinking of all the possibilities that I could create starting from that command <b>cout</b>. From that word my idea of a text based game started. In the game you had different options and based on your choice the story would evolve differently, all that without a graphical interface, only your imagination. And that was only the start of my programming adventure.

                One of my biggest passions at this moment is the gym. There I can feel free and escape from the world. Not only that it is very healthy to practice a sport, but let me tell you the girls like a fit guy &#128516. But of course the main reason I started it it was for my health and after I saw all the benefits it came along with and the gains, I quickly realised that the gym it's a lifestile, a very interesting lifestile.

                I can say that my main programming language is C++ because it was the first programming language that I ever learned and also mastered. Starting from the highschool when I learned the basics it also appeared in 2 of my faculty's classes. From there I learned data structures and algorithms in C/C++. First, I thought why do I need to learn so many things about data structures or algorithms, this is not what programming should be! Well, I was wrong, maybe that is not what programming is but it's a base that every good programmer should have. So from the moment I realised that I started solving leetcode problems and also read some books about this topic and I can say that I mastered pretty well this fascinating programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup.

                Similarly to C++, the C programming language didn't represent any threat to my programming career. The first meeting that I have with C was in faculty, there I didn't study it at all, but funny, I got my exam without a problem just by studying it with a night before. It is so similar to C++ that if you know C++ you automatically know C, with of course some exceptions.

And later I also convinced a friend to come with me. It was a very good idea for us and our careers because we learned some things that are not taught in schools.

                  When it comes to Python's popularity and growth rate, the numbers don't lie. According to the <a href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index</a>, Python is the most-searched programming language on the internet — and that doesn't look like it will be changing any time soon. According to Stack Overflow, Python is also the fastest-growing programming language, and TIOBE gave it the 2020 Programming Language of the Year award as it gained popularity faster than any other language. Part of this acclaim is due to Python's usefulness in the world of data science; as fields like machine learning, data modeling, and AI grow, so too does the demand for Python-related skills. All of this means that, if you're looking for a new programming language to learn — or looking to transition into the field of programming — Python is a wise choice.

                Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile. It doesn't matter if you are in high school or are in the first year of your college, if you have the curiosity to learn to code, today is the day to start.

Software developers also use databases to store and manage user information, so mastery of SQL is critical.

                  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

                    Engineers and scientists need a programming language that lets them express matrix and array mathematics directly. Linear algebra in MATLAB is intuitive and concise. The same is true for data analytics, signal and image processing, control design, and other applications.

                        PHP is useful for developing e-commerce applications, content management systems, and other websites that need to store large data on the server side. Also, it has excellent support from a large community of developers who build frameworks and libraries to make coding easier

                Video games are increasingly being used to engage and motivate students, but do <a href="https://gamequitters.com/how-gaming-affects-learning-in-college/">video games lead to learning gains?</a>The American Psychological Association (APA) has looked at how video games effect learning and recognizes that more research is needed. <br>
                    <br>
                In 2015, they reported that over the last 20 years, there had been nine major reviews of research into the effectiveness of educational video games which had found the research to be “highly diverse, disorganized and unfocused, with a significant number of methodologically flawed studies.” <br>
                   <br>
                A subsequent study by Robles and Quintero in 2020 found that video games can be effective for teaching high school math skills. The students studied showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered.
