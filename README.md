# MyWebsite âœ”

Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can learn a new language. In fact, programming is kind of like speaking a foreign language, which is exactly why they're called programming languages.

# HTML

HTML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create the vast majority of website content

# CSS & JavaScript

CSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations. On the other hand, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries. These three languages, in my opinion, are the fundamentals of front-end development.
